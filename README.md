Sickle Cell Disease(SCD) is a prevalent genetic blood disorder, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where frequent blood transfusions are often required due to complications like severe anemia. 
This study explores the use of Machine Learning (ML) to predict the frequency of blood transfusions for SCD patients, using clinical data from 100 patients at Le-Memorial Hospital in Uganda. 
A regression-based approach, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, was employed to predict transfusion frequency. 
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were integrated to provide interpretable insights into model predictions. 
The results highlight the effectiveness of ML in optimizing transfusion management, improving resource allocation, and enhancing patient care, particularly in low-resource settings. The study underscores the importance of incorporating regional factors and explainable AI in healthcare applications to support informed decision-making
